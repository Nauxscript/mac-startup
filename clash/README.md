## What for

sometime we use Clash in defferent network environment, such as home, company, or the other. For example, in the company I working, the all repos / sources are store in private servers, access by private network with local domain or specific ip address, like `200.111.*.*`;to ensure network all fineÔºåwe could setup [whitelist](./proxyIgnoreList.plist).

add the ip„ÄÅdomian after `<string>my-custom-site.com</string>`, or replace it. refer to [ClashX proxyIgnoreList template](https://github.com/yichengchen/clashX/blob/master/proxyIgnoreList.plist).
